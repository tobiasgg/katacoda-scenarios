# Our two software modules we want to test
In this step we will present the two software modules we want to perform integration testing on.

The first one, `/server/simple_webserver.py`{{open}}, is a simple python HTTP webserver that listens for HTTP requests on port 8080. If a request is made the server should log the request to the console. This is the functionality we want to test later on. 

To build this application we have used the built in `http` python package. 

The second module, `/client/client.py`{{open}}, simulates a client and performs an HTTP request to our server.

The "logging requests"-functionality of the server is the one we will test in our integration tests later on.

Since these two modules require some additional dependencies we will run the command
`pip install requests`{{execute}}.
